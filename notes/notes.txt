ORDER
  #.  Check if cluster exists (set new_cluster)

  #.  Perform DNS check (dns_check_passed )

  #.  Check if main nodes exist (set increase_control_plane_nodes, decrease_control_plane_nodes, kubernetes_control_plane_node_modify_count)

  #.  Check if worker nodes exist (set increase_worker_nodes, decrease_worker_nodes, worker_node_modify_count)

  #.  Create new main virtual machines
  #.  Evict main nodes from cluster
      - Stop KeepaliveD so can no longer be the main
      - Template out all configs for the to-remove node
      - Evict node

  #.  Setup haproxy/keepalived on main machines, adding and removing hosts at will
        - If new main nodes are added, then add them to the haproxy/keepalived config for all
        - If main nodes are removed, then remove them from all config before deprovisioning

  #.  If new cluster, init new cluster (new_cluster)

  #.  Grab Join token for main nodes

  #.  Join nodes to new cluster

  NEW WORKER NODES
  #.  Create new worker virtual machines
  #.  Grab Join token for worker nodes
  #.  Join worker nodes to cluster

  DEL WORKER NODES
  #.  Delete node from cluster
  #.  Remove Virtual Machine
